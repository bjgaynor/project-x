<h1>There has been an error extracting the data from your spreadsheet to Zillow and back to our database.<br><br>  Odds are, one or more of the addresses is not a zillow listing.<br><br>  In the future we will automatically check for this but right now, you must make sure that all properties listed are able to be found on Zillow based on the exact addresses you have provided.<br><br>  Another error could be that you uploaded a spreadsheet that is not in the agreed upon format.<br><br> Only a two column spreadsheet with address and city,state,zip fields is permitted.<br><br> Better go back and try again.<h1><br><br>
